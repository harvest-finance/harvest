/*
*   This is a general strategy for yields that are based on the synthetix reward contract
*   for example, yam, spaghetti, ham, shrimp.
*
*   One strategy is deployed for one underlying asset, but the design of the contract
*   should allow it to switch between different reward contracts.
*
*   It is important to note that not all SNX reward contracts that are accessible via the same interface are
*   suitable for this Strategy. One concrete example is CREAM.finance, as it implements a "Lock" feature and
*   would not allow the user to withdraw within some timeframe after the user have deposited.
*   This would be problematic to user as our "invest" function in the vault could be invoked by anyone anytime
*   and thus locking/reverting on subsequent withdrawals. Another variation is the YFI Governance: it can
*   activate a vote lock to stop withdrawal.

*
*
*   Respecting the current system design of choosing the best strategy under the vault, and also rewarding/funding
*   the public key that invokes the switch of strategies, this smart contract should be deployed twice and linked
*   to the same vault. When the governance want to rotate the crop, they would set the reward source on the strategy
*   that is not active, then set that apy higher and this one lower.
*
*   Consequently, in the smart contract we restrict that we can only set a new reward source when it is not active.
